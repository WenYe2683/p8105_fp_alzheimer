# Research Questions

The purposes of this project is to answer the following questions:

1. **Geographic Variation**: How does the prevalence of self-reported cognitive decline vary across U.S. states and territories?

2. **Demographic Patterns**: Are there differences in cognitive burden by age group and sex?

3. **Socioeconomic Factors**: Is state-level median household income associated with cognitive decline prevalence?

4. **Educational Attainment**: Does the proportion of adults with higher education relate to cognitive outcomes?

5. **Environmental Exposures**: Is air pollution (PM2.5) associated with cognitive decline at the state level?

# Discussion and Limitations
Our analysis relies on data from 2015–2016 due to the availability of specific 'Cognitive Decline' modules in the BRFSS dataset during these years. While this data is a decade old, it serves as a vital pre-pandemic baseline for cognitive health in the US. Furthermore, given the chronic nature of Alzheimer's disease and the stability of state-level socioeconomic stratifications, the associations identified here likely reflect persistent structural inequalities. This project establishes a reproducible workflow that can be applied to future dataset releases to track longitudinal shifts in these associations.
