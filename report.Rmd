Our analysis relies on data from 2015–2016 due to the availability of specific 'Cognitive Decline' modules in the BRFSS dataset during these years. While this data is a decade old, it serves as a vital pre-pandemic baseline for cognitive health in the US. Furthermore, given the chronic nature of Alzheimer's disease and the stability of state-level socioeconomic stratifications, the associations identified here likely reflect persistent structural inequalities. This project establishes a reproducible workflow that can be applied to future dataset releases to track longitudinal shifts in these associations.
