# Project Overview

Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive impairments represent one of the most pressing public health challenges facing our aging population. This project examines geographic, demographic, and environmental patterns associated with cognitive decline among older adults in the United States.

<div class="stat-box">
<strong>Key Dataset Statistics:</strong>

- **32,616** total observations from CDC BRFSS
- **59** states and territories analyzed
- **2015-2016** survey years for cognitive data
- **39** distinct health topics covered
</div>

# Research Questions

Our analysis explores three critical dimensions of cognitive health:

<div class="card">
## 1. Geographic Disparities
Which U.S. states and regions show the highest prevalence of cognitive decline among adults aged 65 and older? How do these patterns vary between 2015 and 2016?
</div>

<div class="card">
## 2. Socioeconomic Factors
How do income levels and educational attainment relate to Alzheimer's-related cognitive outcomes across states?
</div>

<div class="card">
## 3. Environmental Influences
Does air pollution (measured by PM2.5 concentrations) show an association with state-level cognitive burden?
</div>

# Why This Matters

Cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease affect millions of Americans and their families:

- Alzheimer's is the **6th leading cause of death** in the United States
- An estimated **6.9 million Americans** aged 65+ are living with Alzheimer's disease
- Understanding geographic and socioeconomic patterns can help target interventions and resources
- Environmental factors may offer modifiable risk factors for prevention strategies

# Dataset Highlights

Our primary data source is the **CDC Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Data**, derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). We focused on survey items related to:

- **Cognitive decline** among adults aged 45+
- **Cognitive impairment** and its impact on daily activities
- **Caregiver burden** associated with memory problems

These self-reported measures capture the population-level burden of Alzheimer's-related cognitive issues, though they differ from clinical diagnoses.
